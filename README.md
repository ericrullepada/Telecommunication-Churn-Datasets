**EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

In this project, I analyzed customer data from a telecommunications company to uncover key patterns and drivers behind customer churn. Using SQL for data extraction and Power BI for in-depth analysis and visualization, I identified high-risk customer segments and critical factors contributing to churnâ€”such as contract type, tenure, and service usage. These insights help stakeholders take targeted actions to improve customer retention and reduce churn rates across specific categories.
